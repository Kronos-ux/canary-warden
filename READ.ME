# canary-warden

A simple tool to detect ransomware-like activity by watching "canary" files for suspicious changes.

## Quick Start

1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run:
   python -m src.canary_warden.cli --folders 2 --files 5 --threshold 8

3. Try demo mode (simulates attacks!):
   python -m src.canary_warden.cli --demo

## What It Does

- Makes folders and files for fake "decoys."
- Watches if lots of things change really fast.
- Says "Alert!" if it thinks an attack is happening.
- Only for learningâ€”never deletes or damages your files.
